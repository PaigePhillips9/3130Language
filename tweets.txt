It’s the Patriots or the Buccaneers. 

2 possible destinations for Tom Brady

Chris Simms, longtime friend of #49ers coach Kyle Shanahan, says SF is out and there appear to be two teams in play for Tom Brady: Patriots and Buccaneers.

Sources tell @CSimmsQB that the 49ers are not interested in Tom Brady and his final decision comes down to the Buccaneers or returning to the Patriots.

A team w/ the cap room to trade for the contract of #Rams' Todd Gurley? The #Buccaneers. If Tampa Bay thinks he's healthy enough for a gamble, a deal for Gurley could boost a Tom Brady pitch, too. Gurley's deal easy for suitors to exit in 2021, too. No risk it, no biscuit, right?

#GoBucs have made it clear they want Tom Brady to be the next QB of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers according to the NFLN.

O Tampa Bay Buccaneers está movendo fundos e mundos para tentar acertar com o QB Tom Brady (NE). Ainda não há nada remotamente perto de acertado, mas estão tentando.

I believe the #Buccaneers plan is to pull out the stops for Tom Brady. Beyond that, a #Saints source is convinced Teddy Bridgewater is a target in Tampa if Brady doesn’t happen. Saints believe in Teddy. But they also love Taysom’s ceiling. With Brees back, options were limited.
