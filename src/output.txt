Glad for the July 4th parade which to me honors all the military men who made us free and those who have continue to keep us free by their dedication.  Trump is a patriot and democrats are against honoring those who made and keep us free.  God Bless Trump and our military. USA
Are u serious? Trump bombed Syria, and Obama stifled oil production while Trump opened the floodgates... The US is producing lots more oil, guess who that hurts big time??? R U S S I A!!!
Wow. This is amazing. You are made of steel there Barb. Whatever will Trump do?
Where did the CIA say that? At worst Russia might have interfered within the elections but there is no evidence of Trump going upfront to the Russians and colluding with them.
It’s the Chinese government hacking our haarp systems to “rain on trumps parade” because of the trade war
Lol .... jk but on serious note what u think about al the trades who do u got one and two west and east

2/ Your administration is the most prolific purveyor of “fake news”, this being a prime example. The world is watching as you try to scare people away from participating in a constitutionally-mandated census so your GOP cronies can grab more seats in Congress. We see you.
Once again, if Trump wasn't POTUS, he'd have been compelled to appear in Court to answer for himself. He's going to cling tightly to the protection afforded him as president. 2020 is gonna get UGLY.

hardly seems like he can multi

with all the pressing issues he is worried about a military parade

parades, walls and worrying if people applaud him

God help us all
At this point you guys should just raze everything to the ground and rebuild the WH. Trump and his administration have forever tarnished what the WH should stand for. #TrumpMustGo
Personally, I think Trump does anything and everything just to piss off the public.. Because he can.  He's the man in charge and he won't let you forget it.. ugh.
Shouldn’t our great military be spending its time and resources managing the security of the United States at its many operations all over the world, instead of creating a military pageant for Little Rocket Man? Shouldn’t you intuitively realize this and know not to burden them?

Because a parade is a waste of money and time.
Need to boast 45s ego....clap for him..
Such a joke..
We all support our military..
45 is feeling Quilty because he avoided SERVING OUR COUNTRY.. I can’t forget that...@realDonaldTrump
@LindseyGrahamSC You do realize that those forced to make up Trump's parade are NOT going to be happy campers. My husband is a retired Vet and marching in a dog and pony show just pissed him, and his fellow soldiers, off. Yes dog and pony show is what he called a military parade!
A Criminal-in-Chief pardoned a traitor!?! 
@realDonaldTrump Mr.President, while still awake at 3am I had this passing thought maybe a great campaign slogan. When you run again, does that mean you have “2020 Vision”? This is the stuff I think about when I’m wide awake in the muddle if the night.  BTW, you’re doing great!
It is appalling that our Congress/Senate is allowing this insanity to continue! Trump is unfit to govern and must be held in check before his delusional ideas destroy us all! #NoMilitaryParade #NoWall #NoWar #CensureTrump #ImpeachTrump #ImplementTheRussianSanctions
